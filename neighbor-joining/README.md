Assuming you save the script as "neighbor_joining.rs", you can run the script with the input file path as the first command line argument by typing cargo run --release -- <input_file_path> in the directory containing the script and the input file. The --release flag tells Cargo to optimize the code for speed. The script will print the Newick string of the neighbor-joining tree. You can use a program like FigTree to visualize the tree.
